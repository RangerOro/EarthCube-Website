Your vote for EarthCube on its voting sites is really important for us. This permits us to reach more players, and you will gain rewards, too!

### How to Vote

You can vote on the **official EarthCube voting sites**, you can find them by running `/vote` on the server.

You can also find them here:
1. https://vote.earthcubemc.net/1/
2. https://vote.earthcubemc.net/2/
3. https://vote.earthcubemc.net/3/
4. https://vote.earthcubemc.net/4/
5. https://vote.earthcubemc.net/5/

Voting on all these sites will get you **5 Vote Crates**, so 1 for every site you vote on. If you aren't online on the server but still vote, you will be able to access your crates in the future with `/cr claim`!

Vote Crates, when opened, give **gold, discs and other valuable materials**.

Also, the best voter of the month will get his name displayed in the bottom-right part of the tab. At the end of the month, the best voter gets **3.99$ of webstore credit** to buy our packages!
