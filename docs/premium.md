To get the Premium role, you have to access to our [Tebex webstore](https://earthcubemc-shop.tebex.io/), where you'll be able to buy it.

Once you buy it, you will get the role automatically in Discord (if you `/discord link`ed) and in-game.

All the profit from the Premium and other paid crates will be invested in the server for making your experience better.
We are not a pay-to-win server, so you won't get any unfair advantage over other players.
