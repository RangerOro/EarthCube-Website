The only currency on EarthCube is gold ingots, 1 gold ingot is 1 unit of currency. The economy is totally player-driven. There are no town or nation taxes.
With gold, you can:
- Create [towns](/docs/towns) and [nations](/docs/nations)
- Access [planets](/docs/planets)
- [Buy and sell](/docs/shops) items to other players
- Engage in various economic activities

### Earning Gold

Gold can be earned through various ways:
- Voting for the server with `/vote`, which will give you one Vote Crate
- [Selling possessions](/docs/shops) to other players
- Mining gold ore, then smelting it
- Win staff or player endorsed events, where gold is awarded.

Once you have one (or multiple) gold ingots in your hand, you can deposit them in your bank account with `/sell hand`.
If you want to store gold in your town or nation, just do `/t deposit {amount}` or `/n deposit {amount}` respectively.
If you want to withdraw gold from your town or nation, the command is `/t withdraw {amount}` or `/n withdraw {amount}`.
