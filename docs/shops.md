Shops are very important in the server's economy as they permit players to exchange their items for gold and vice-versa. Shops are entirely run by players, except for the AdminShop in the spawn area.

### How to Create a Shop

To create a shop, you should first be owner of a plot. You can claim a plot in your town with `/plot claim`. If you're a town mayor, you won't need this as you own all the plots. Change plot type from default to shop with `/plot set shop`. Read more about plots [here](/docs/towns#plots).

After doing so, you can proceed:

1. Place a chest inside the shop plot
2. Hold the item you wish to sell
3. Left click the chest while holding the item.
4. Enter in chat how much gold you want to sell the item for.
5. Place stock in chest.

You have now successfully created a shop!

### Good to Know

Remember to fill the chest with items to sell. Red sign text indicates that stock has run out. Consider creating a double chest shop for larger stock storage.

Clicking a shop with higher item quanity will sell that quantity for the specififed amount of gold. For example, you will sell a bulk of 64 planks if you click a shop holding 64 planks.
