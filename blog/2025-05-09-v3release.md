This day, the new version of the server came out, making a new era begin.
Here are some of the most important changes on EarthCube V3 that you should be aware of.

<!-- truncate -->

### Main changes

First of all, Crossplay. Yes, you heard right, not like the most of Earth servers, now we accept almost everyone on the server (Still no cracked support, and that is not to come in the near future)

Then we got Planets! A never seen feature on any Earth server, completely developed by the Owner of EarthCube - Ranger_Oro. Feel free to report any bugs you found regarding the Planets plugin or any other feature on our server in the [Discord](https://discord.earthcubemc.net/).
There's also a [documentation page](/docs/planets) about the Planets.

We also migrated the server to another hosting service to ensure you have the best playing experience. While the migration brought us better experience, it also caused changes about our servers IP address. If you were playing EarthCube before, you might know its IP address as `earthcube.mcserver.us` but upon migration it changed to `play.earthcubemc.net` and the previous one is **no longer available**. More detailed info of how to join you can find [here](/docs/join).

If you played EarthCube before you probably already noticed that we rebranded. The logo was changed and the Discord server was revamped. Both designed by Ziurkiusss.

Next to that, we released our new, rebranded and improved webstore, where you can buy various ranks and lootboxes.

And as you might've already noticed (would be weird if you didn't) that we have a new website! (Made by Ranger_Oro)

### Other updates of V3

V3 features alot of bug fixes and feature improvements on the technical side for you to enjoy playing on our server.

There also was some changes to the premium permissions, you can access the full list on our [Discord](https://discord.earthcubemc.net/) or on the [Webstore](https://store.earthcubemc.net/). To engage our players we added some extra rewards, upon purchases of premium packages you will receive Legendary Lootboxes, the amount depends on the length of the Premium.

Now about some free rewards each of you can get, for that we added 5 voting sites that can be accessed through our Discord server or using an in-game `/vote` command. For each vote you will receive a Vote Crate which includes rewards like gold, a great way to get your hands on some gold. Not only that but after the server reaches a milestone of 100 votes, a pinata party will be started which you could access with command `/warp pinata` and get even MORE gold. The player with the most votes at the end of each month will recieve a 3.99$ balance on our webstore.

To add an extra layer of protection to our server and community, we integrated advanced anticheat to keep hackers away and antiVPN to stop players ban evading.

Last but not least, we reduced the size of our map from 1:500 to 1:750 to ensure smooth gameplay experience. The live map of the Earth can be viewed [here](https://map.earthcubemc.net/).

### Good resolutions for the new season

For this new version, we have big plans in mind. Not only completely getting out of beta the Planets plugin, but also improving player count and adding new unique functionalities.

For this to happen, we have to look back at our history.

The first version of our server was ran by another player, which is not Ranger_Oro. That was the best part of our history so far, because it was characterized by a great
player count, more than **300 unique players** joined back then and we reached **40 players online** at the same time on the server.

Though, when the original owner left and Ranger_Oro took over, version 2 started, and the server died quickly.

Our goal now is to embrace our future, break down the doors of Impossibility... and bring EarthCube to a new beginning, where we'll shine and smash our past records, where you, especially you can help.

We will surely add more features in the future, so that your experience will be the best. For now, you can support us by buying our packages in the [Official Webstore](https://store.earthcubemc.net), or by boosting our Discord server. That will keep us running! Thanks in advance for your purchases.

### Final thoughts

If you join our server now, you will be part of something big tomorrow...

We hope you will like the server!
